# HCP Terraform Workspaces Factory

Code which manages configuration and life-cycle of all the HCP Terraform
workspaces factory. It is designed to be used from a dedicated
API-Driven HCP Terraform workspace that would provision and manage the
configuration using Terraform code (IaC).

> Workspace creation and management is facilitated through a no-code
> module. Each no-code module must be provisioned within the dedicated project
> to ensure proper variable input configuration and management.

## Permissions

### HCP Terraform Permissions

To manage resources, provide a user token from an account with appropriate permissions.
This user should have the `Manage Projects`, `Manage Workspaces`, `Manage Teams`,
`Manage Membership`, and `Manage Organization Access` permission. Alternatively, you
can use a token from a team instead of a user token.

## Authentication

### HCP Terraform Authentication

The HCP Terraform provider requires a HCP Terraform/Terraform Enterprise API token in
order to manage resources.

There are several ways to provide the required token:

* Set the `token` argument in the provider configuration. You can set the token argument in the provider configuration. Use an
input variable for the token.
* Set the `TFE_TOKEN` environment variable. The provider can read the TFE\_TOKEN environment variable and the token stored there
to authenticate.
